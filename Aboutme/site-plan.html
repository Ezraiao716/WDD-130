        Hello and welcome to my personal website. I make this website because sometimes when people see my résumé or school paper, they do not really know who I am inside. I want to make a place where people like future employer, new friend, or classmate can learn about my life, my family, what I like to do, and my plan for the future. I was born and grew up in Macau, and I lived there for 20 years. After that, I moved to Canada for 2 years, and now I have been in the U.S. for 4 years. Living in different places help me learn to understand different people and culture. I can speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Spanish. I feel lucky because these languages let me connect with many different people. In my free time, I like to play the flute and play soccer. These two things help me relax, feel happy, and stay healthy. I will also share about my talents and what I work hard for in my life. I think it is important not only to show what we can do, but also to tell people what kind of person we try to be. This website is not like LinkedIn or school page. It is more personal and warm. I hope when people visit my website, they can feel who I am, what I believe, and what I dream for my future.
