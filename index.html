    <p>I am majoring in Software Engineering, and I want to become a software engineer. <p>I love playing soccer with friends. 
        I am currently single. I hope to gain more knowledge of web design from this class. In the future, I want to build a 
        website for my own brand. <p></p>I was born in the church. I really like "However many mistakes you feel you've made...
        It is not possible for you to sink lower than the infintie light of Christ's Atonement shines." by Elder Holland. I 
        really like Alma 37:37. <p></p>I served my mission in Canada Vancouver, mandarin speaking. <p>
